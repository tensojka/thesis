The public-key cryptography used today (RSA, ElGamal,
elliptic-curve cryptography) can theoretically be broken by
quantum computers. One possible approach to post-quantum
cryptography is lattice-based cryptography, whose security
relies on the fact that some lattice problems are classified as
NP-hard problems (including SVP). The thesis presents the basic
algorithms for the lattice basis reduction used to find the
approximate shortest vector and the enumeration that allows
finding the exact solution of the SVP. This work introduces new
approaches to solving SVP based on the Gram matrix, Cholesky
decomposition and quadratic form. Practical examples are codes
in the Python language and the system of SageMath. The
different approaches are tested and analyzed. The results show
the average distance of the optimum from the shortest vector.
